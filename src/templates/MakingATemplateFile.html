        <H1>Making a Template Listing File</H1>
        <p>Template listing files are used as an index for the creation of multiple source files in a package.  template
            listings contain a multiplicity value, source template file, and a destination file pattern.</p>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <code>PER_STRUCT cpp/myfile.cpp  -&lt;series_dir&gt;-/-&lt;datatype_name&gt;-.cpp </code>
        <br/>

        <p>In the above example, the multiplicity is <code>PER_STRUCT</code>, which means that the template will
            be used to create a source file for every struct in the MDM.  The source file is "myfile.cpp" in the cpp
            directory (directory trees are assumed to start in the templates directory.) The output files will be
            named by their structs with a .cpp extension. </p>

        <h2>Valid multiplicty tags</h2>
        <p>The following multiplicity tags are recognized:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>ONCE</code>  Creates a single instance of the new file based on the template.</li>
            <li><code>PER_MDM</code>  Creates a instance of the file for every MDM encountered.</li>
            <li><code>PER_STRUCT</code> Creates a file for every struct encountered in each MDM.</li>
            <li><code>PER_ENUM</code> Creates a file for every enum encountered in each MDM.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Text Replacement</h2>
        <p> Every time a <code>-&lt;some_text&gt;-</code> tag is encountered in a template listing file the text and
            the open/close tags are replaced by text produced in the <i>Methods</i> class that has been selected by
            the LMCP generation session.
